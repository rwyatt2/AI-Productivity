# Data sensitivity overlay — Internal

**Add this emphasis when the data is for internal use only (e.g. team, org).**

* Not for public or partner exposure; focus on access control and accidental leakage.
* Emphasize: role-based access; no sharing or export to external parties without approval; audit who accessed what.
* Guardrails: not in public docs, logs, or error messages; internal-only storage and transport.
