# Exposure overlay — Internal only

**Add this emphasis when the scope is internal-only (e.g. behind VPN, corp network, or same-org only).**

* Assume attackers are not on the network; focus on insider risk and misconfiguration.
* Emphasize: least privilege, audit of sensitive access, no accidental exposure to internet.
* Guardrails: no public endpoints; no external auth; internal docs and runbooks not world-readable.
