# Company profile

Use this when the project is for work (your employer or a client).

**Expectations:**
* Stricter: follow company security and compliance. No shortcuts.
* Spec and implementation both need sign-off or review where your org requires it.
* Use the security checklist and threat-model-lite when the work touches auth, uploads, sensitive data, or external systems.
* Document decisions and "why" in specs so others can pick it up.

**Checklists:** Prefer **spec-dod**, **impl-dod**, and **security-dod** before marking done. Use **threat-model-lite** when a trigger in 40-security applies.
