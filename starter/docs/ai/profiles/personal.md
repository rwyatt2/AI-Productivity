# Personal profile

Use this for side projects, learning, or your own apps.

**Expectations:**
* Lighter process, but still: no secrets in code, least privilege, and clear spec-before-code when the change is non-trivial.
* You can skip full threat-model-lite for low-risk, internal-only experiments—but if you add auth, uploads, or handle real user data, run the security checklist and threat-model-lite.
* Keep ai-config.md updated (design system, defaults) so the AI stays consistent.

**Checklists:** Use **spec-dod** and **impl-dod** for bigger features. Use **security-dod** and **threat-model-lite** when you touch anything sensitive or exposed.
