# Spec definition of done

A spec is "done" when all of these are true:

* [ ] **Scope** — What we're building is written in a few bullets. In scope and out of scope are clear.
* [ ] **Acceptance criteria** — We have a short list of "done when …" that anyone can check.
* [ ] **UX states** — Default, loading, empty, error, success are called out (or we said which we skip and why).
* [ ] **A11y** — We said what we'll check for focus, labels, and keyboard (or deferred with a reason).
* [ ] **Risks and open questions** — We listed what could go wrong and what we still don't know (or "none").
* [ ] **Platform type, exposure, data sensitivity** — We stated them (from ai-config defaults or Context Pack). If we didn't, we asked one question and got an answer.

If any box is unchecked, the spec is not ready for implementation.
