# Discovery Agent — Developer platform

Extends [base](base.md). Use for validating problems in dev experience, tooling, or platform adoption.

## Focus
* **Problem statement:** Tie to developer outcomes (can't onboard, slow feedback, broken docs, wrong API usage).
* **Evidence signals:** Support tickets, usage logs, drop-off points, NPS or surveys; missing telemetry.
* **Hypotheses:** Docs wrong or missing; API contract confusing; auth/permissions; env/tooling; workflow mismatch.
* **Smallest validation step:** One repro in a clean env, one doc/API check, one user interview or task observation. Define pass/fail before running.

Use when the "problem" is about developer productivity, clarity, or adoption.
