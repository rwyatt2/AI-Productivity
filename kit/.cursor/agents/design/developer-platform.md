# Design Agent — Developer platform

Extends [base](base.md). Use for dev tools, docs sites, APIs explorers, and platform UIs.

## Focus
* **Clarity over decoration:** Code, commands, and config are primary; UI supports scanning and copy-paste.
* **Navigation & hierarchy:** Clear doc/topic structure; breadcrumbs or sidebar; deep links that work.
* **Feedback:** Copy confirmation, run/execute states, logs/terminal output readability.
* **Onboarding & empty:** First-time setup, “no resources yet” states, and next-step CTAs.
* **A11y:** Keyboard-first for power users; code blocks and syntax with readable contrast; focus order matches workflow.

Align states and interactions with developer workflows: read docs, run commands, inspect results, configure.
