# Data sensitivity overlay — Confidential

**Add this emphasis when the data is confidential (e.g. business-sensitive, pre-release).**

* Unauthorized disclosure would cause material harm; treat as need-to-know.
* Emphasize: strict access control; encryption at rest and in transit; no logging or caching of raw confidential data; secure disposal.
* Guardrails: only authorized roles and systems; audit every access; no copy to less-secure envs without approval.
