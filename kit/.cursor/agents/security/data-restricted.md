# Data sensitivity overlay — Restricted

**Add this emphasis when the data is restricted (e.g. PII, regulated, or highly sensitive).**

* Highest sensitivity; regulatory or legal implications for misuse or breach.
* Emphasize: minimal collection and retention; encryption; access logging and monitoring; no sharing without formal process; compliance (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA) where applicable.
* Guardrails: dedicated controls; no secrets in code/logs; breach response plan; regular access review.
