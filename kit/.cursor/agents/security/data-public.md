# Data sensitivity overlay — Public

**Add this emphasis when the data in scope is intended for public consumption.**

* No confidentiality requirement for the data itself; focus on integrity and availability.
* Emphasize: prevent tampering, defacement, or abuse that would mislead users; protect availability.
* Guardrails: no PII or internal data mixed in; clear separation from non-public data stores.
