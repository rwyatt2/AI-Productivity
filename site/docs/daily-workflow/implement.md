title: Daily workflow (IMPLEMENT)
---

IMPLEMENT mode is for code changes.

Use IMPLEMENT when you explicitly want:
* a PR plan
* code edits
* file changes
* tests
* bug fixes

## How to enter IMPLEMENT mode
Either:
* Ask directly: "Implement this change"
or
* Say: Switch: IMPLEMENT

## What you should get back
An "Implementation Package" including:
* files to change
* a short plan
* concrete edits
* verification checklist
* tests (or reason why not)
* security notes when triggers apply

## Safety rules (simple)
* Minimal safe diffs
* No made-up file paths or APIs
* Ask exactly one question if blocked
