title: Daily workflow (SPEC-first)
---

SPEC is the default mode.

Use SPEC when:
* you are not sure what the best solution is yet
* you need acceptance criteria
* you need UX states (loading/empty/error/success)
* you want to validate the problem
* you want to think about security risks

## The 3-step routine
1) Paste Session Kickoff
2) Paste a filled Context Pack
3) Paste Router

## What you should get back
A "Spec Package" that includes:
* problem statement
* acceptance criteria
* non-goals
* UX states
* accessibility
* risks and open questions
* platform type, exposure level, data sensitivity

## If it asks a question
It must ask EXACTLY ONE question.
Answer it, then it should continue.

## If you want code now
Say:
* Switch: IMPLEMENT
