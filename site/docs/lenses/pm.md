# What this is

The PM lens helps answer: What are we building? Who is it for? How do we know it worked? It produces a clear list of what “done” looks like (acceptance criteria), what we are not doing (non-goals), edge cases, and open questions.

## When to use it

The Router uses it in SPEC mode. You don’t run it by itself. You paste Session Kickoff and Context Pack and the AI uses PM (and other lenses) to build the spec.

## Steps

**Do this:**

1. Use SPEC mode (Session Kickoff + Context Pack + Router).
2. The AI will use the PM lens to give you:
   * Acceptance criteria (what must be true when we’re done)
   * Non-goals (what we are not doing)
   * Edge cases and open questions
3. If something is missing, answer the one question the AI asks, then it continues.

## Common mistakes

* Asking for “acceptance criteria” in IMPLEMENT mode. Use SPEC mode first.
* Writing a long essay instead of bullet points. The PM lens works best when you give short, clear inputs and get back a clear list.
