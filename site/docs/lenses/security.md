title: Security lens (cybersecurity)
---

Security is included by default because it is easy to forget.

The Security lens helps answer:
* What could go wrong?
* Who could abuse this?
* How do we prevent data leaks and permission mistakes?

## When security gets deeper
Security escalates if you touch:
* auth, roles, permissions
* sensitive data
* uploads, URLs, rich text
* external exposure
* admin tools
* exports / downloads

## What it outputs (simple)
* top threats
* mitigations
* security acceptance criteria (testable)
