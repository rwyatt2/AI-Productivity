title: Data sensitivity

Data sensitivity means: "How bad is it if this data leaks?"

## Values
* public
* internal
* confidential
* restricted

## Examples
public:
* safe to share on the internet

internal:
* company internal info

confidential:
* sensitive business info, private project info

restricted:
* secrets, credentials, high-risk personal data, regulated data

## Why it matters
Even internal tools can be high risk if they touch restricted data.
So data sensitivity is separate from exposure level.
