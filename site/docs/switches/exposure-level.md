title: Exposure level
---

# What this is

Exposure level means: who can reach this thing? Only your company, only people who sign in, or everyone on the internet? More exposure usually means more risk, so the kit thinks harder about security when exposure is high.

## When to use it

You set it in the Context Pack. Use it for every task so the AI knows how careful to be.

## Steps

**Do this:**

1. In the Context Pack, pick one:
   * **internal** — Only on your company network, VPN, or behind sign-in that only your org uses.
   * **external-authenticated** — On the internet, but users must sign in.
   * **public** — On the internet, no sign-in needed.
2. The kit uses this to decide how deep to go on security (e.g. abuse, spam, privacy).

## Common mistakes

* Saying “internal” when the feature is actually on the public web. That underplays risk.
* Saying “public” when only logged-in users can see it. That overplays risk and can make the AI too cautious. Use external-authenticated instead.
