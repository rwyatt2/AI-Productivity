title: Platform type
---

Platform type tells the kit what kind of platform you are working on.

## Values
* data-platform
* developer-platform

## Why it matters
A data platform PM/design/security checklist is different from a developer platform checklist.

## If you forget to include it
The AI should:
* ask EXACTLY ONE question:
    "Is this for the data platform or developer platform?"
* stop and wait
