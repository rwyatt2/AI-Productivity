# What this is

Platform type tells the kit what kind of product you are building: a **data platform** (data, reports, dashboards) or a **developer platform** (tools for other developers). The checklist and advice change based on this.

## When to use it

You set it in the Context Pack. The AI uses it to decide what to focus on (e.g. data safety vs API design).

## Steps

**Do this:**

1. In the Context Pack, pick one:
   * **data-platform** — Your product is about data, analytics, reports, or dashboards.
   * **developer-platform** — Your product is tools, APIs, or docs for other developers.
2. If you don’t know, leave it blank. The AI should ask exactly one question: “Is this for the data platform or the developer platform?” Answer it, then it continues.

## Common mistakes

* Leaving it blank and then answering with a long paragraph. One word (data-platform or developer-platform) is enough.
* Mixing both in one task. Pick the one that fits the current work. You can change it when the task changes.
