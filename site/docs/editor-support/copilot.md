title: GitHub Copilot (optional)
---

This kit also supports GitHub Copilot.

The repo includes:
* `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

That file tells Copilot:
* SPEC-first default
* ask exactly one question if unsure
* do not invent things
* include security when triggered

If you use Copilot in VS Code, keep your work consistent by using:
* the same Context Pack template
* the same switches (platform type, exposure, data sensitivity)
