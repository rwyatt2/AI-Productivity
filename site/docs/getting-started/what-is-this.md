title: What is this?
---

This repo contains an "AI Kit" to help you work faster and safer with AI tools like Cursor.

It helps you:
* Solve the right problem (not just build the first idea)
* Write clear specs (what to build)
* Implement safely (how to build)
* Remember security (so you don't forget important risks)

It works with:
* Cursor (default)
* GitHub Copilot (optional)

## The big idea (super simple)
Every time you ask AI for help, it should:
* Ask only ONE question if it is unsure
* Otherwise give you a clear result

And if it starts doing the wrong thing, you can say:
* Switch: SPEC
* Switch: IMPLEMENT

## Two modes
SPEC mode (default):
* Helps you think and plan (PM + Design + Security when needed)

IMPLEMENT mode:
* Helps you change code (FE + QA + Security notes when needed)
