title: What to fill in
---

These are the only parts of the kit that need your input.

## docs/ai/ai-config.md
* **Design system placeholders** — Design system name, docs URL, imports/package. If you skip these, the kit still works but AI may guess UI patterns.

## docs/ai/project-brief.md
* **What the platform is, who uses it, what success means** — High-level context so the AI understands the product and goals.

## docs/ai/current-state.md
* **Repo conventions** — Routing, state, data patterns, and how the codebase is structured so the AI does not invent or contradict them.

## docs/ai/partner-map.md
* **Who owns what** — Optional but very helpful for knowing which teams or people own which areas.
