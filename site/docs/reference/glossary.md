## What this is

`docs/ai/glossary.md` is the **glossary** template: terms and definitions the AI (and humans) should use consistently. Cap at ~10–20 terms; each entry has definition, common confusion/pitfall, and optional example.

## When to use it

- Add terms that cause real confusion or misuse so the AI does not invent or mix terminology.
- Keep the list scannable.

Terms the AI (and humans) should use consistently. **Cap at ~10–20 terms** so it stays scannable; add only terms that cause real confusion or misuse.

For each term: **definition**, **common confusion/pitfall**, and optionally an **example**.
