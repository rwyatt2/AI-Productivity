title: Project Brief (Reference)

## What this is

`docs/ai/project-brief.md` is the **project brief** template: one-liner, who uses it, jobs-to-be-done, success, non-goals, constraints, and links. The AI uses it to stay aligned with your product.

## When to use it

- After installing the kit: fill it so the AI knows what the platform is and what success means.
- Keep it short; link to longer docs if needed.
