title: Threat model (lite)
---

A threat model does not have to be scary.

It is just a small checklist:

* Exposure level:
* Data sensitivity:
* Assets to protect:
* Entry points:
* Top threats:
* Mitigations:
* Security acceptance criteria:

Use the exact template from:
* Reference → Cursor Rules - Security
or
* docs/ai/checklists/threat-model-lite.md in the kit
