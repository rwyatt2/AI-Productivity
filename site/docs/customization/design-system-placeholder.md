title: Design system (placeholder)
---

The kit includes placeholders for a design system.

You must fill these in:
* Design system name
* Design system docs
* Design system imports/package

File:
* `docs/ai/ai-config.md`

Why?
If you do not fill these, the AI might guess UI patterns.
If you fill them, the AI will stay consistent.
