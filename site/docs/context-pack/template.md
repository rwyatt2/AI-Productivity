title: Context Pack template
---

The Context Pack is the only "big message" you should paste often.

It keeps AI focused and avoids confusion.

## Copy/paste template
Use the exact template from the Reference page:

* Reference → Context Pack Template

## How to fill it (easy)
* Platform type:
    * data-platform OR developer-platform
    * If you don't know, leave blank and the AI will ask one question.
* Exposure level:
    * internal (default)
    * external-authenticated
    * public
* Data sensitivity:
    * internal (default)
    * public / confidential / restricted

## Tip
If you paste too much text or too many files, AI gets confused.
Prefer:
* 3 to 7 relevant files
* short bullet points
