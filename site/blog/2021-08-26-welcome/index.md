Welcome to the blog.

Add Markdown or MDX files (or folders) to the `blog` directory. Post dates come from filenames (e.g. `2021-08-26-welcome.md`). Authors can be defined in `authors.yml`.

<!-- truncate -->

Use tags and the built-in feed as needed. To disable the blog, set `blog: false` in the site config.
